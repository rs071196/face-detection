# face-detection

This project is developed to show my skills in machine learning ,
the project will gonna train the datasets and creates its model which
can be used to recognize the unseen images of that particular person.
The algorithm used to trained the datasets is svm with linear kernel function 
which gives an accuracy over 97% for our datasets.
